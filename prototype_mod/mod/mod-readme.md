# Smarter Belt

A prototype for an improved and enhanced smarter belt system!
- Fixes all the bugs
- Support belt weaving!
- Nearly always connects your belt
- Doesn't mess up existing belts
- ALWAYS notifies if your belt line is broken for any reason.
- Literally every corner case is covered

**Note:** This is currently a prototype, as such is missing some features (see TODO), and is only intended for use in editor mode.

## Usage

1. Enter `/editor`
2. Select any "Smarter transport belt" item
3. Place and drag to create belt lines

**Important:** Belt rotation is a bit finicky due to hacking our way around factorio building: the cursor rotation is only applied to the first belt in a drag; for belt rotations, you must move your cursor around a bit for it to register.

Please test this out and share your feedback!

## TODO

- Implement ghost building and super forced building
- Handle deconstructed belts
- Actually take items from your inventory
- Contact Kovarex
