# Smarter Belt

A prototype for an improved and enhanced smarter belt system!

**Note:** This is currently a prototype, as such is missing features and is only available in editor mode.

## Usage

1. Enter `/editor` mode
2. Select any "Smarter transport belt" item
3. Place and drag to create belt lines

**Important:** Belt rotation is a bit finicky: the cursor rotation is only applied to the first belt in a drag, and you must move your cursor to a bit to register new rotations.

Please test this out and share your feedback!

## TODO

- Implement ghost building and super forced building
- Add inventory checking functionality
- Contact Kovarex
